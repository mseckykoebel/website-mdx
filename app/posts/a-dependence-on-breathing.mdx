I get...meta...really easily - I think a *lot*, to the point where if left unchecked I lose a lot of time in the day. This was more of an issue when I was a kid - I'd spend hours of the day thinking about thinking.

I think one of the reasons meditation has been so appealing to me is that it allows me to "box in" my thoughts so I can more effectively *do* things. If I'm thinking about twenty things, and I need to focus on one, I need to first focus on nothing.

Hence the paradox: before I can do a lot (move between 2-3 things with greater attention), I must first *really* force myself to do nothing.

This kind of focus has, in a lof of ways, helped me mature and prioritize things. On the other hand, it has also set me back. On days when I don't take those ten to fifteen minutes to center myself, I find myself scattered and unable to focus on anything.

While the past three years has seen my focus, and attention to detail, improve due to taking those ten minutes, I hope the next few are filled with learning about other ways to do the same thing.
